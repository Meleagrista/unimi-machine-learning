A centralized hub for organizing code, documentation, and resources related to my academic project. Stay tuned for the detailed report titled: Optimizing Predictive Modeling for Song Popularity with Ridge Regression.

# Abstract
his report conducts a thorough study of a dataset to develop an efficient predictive model for song
popularity. After data acquisition and exploratory analysis, numerical and categorical features were
processed, including reclassification of some columns. Ridge regression with 5-fold cross-validation
assessed the impact of preprocessing techniques on model performance, while grid search optimized the
regularization parameter. Challenges during cross-validation were addressed and resolved to enhance
the accuracy of the predictive model.
